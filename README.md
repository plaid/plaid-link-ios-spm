# Plaid Link iOS for Swift Package Manager

[![version][link-sdk-version]][link-sdk-pod-url] [![swift compatibility][link-sdk-swift-compat]][link-sdk-spi-url]

This repository provides Swift Package Manager support for [plaid-link-ios](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios), allowing you to easily integrate Plaid's financial services into your iOS applications.

### Installing Plaid Link

To install Plaid Link using [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager) you can follow the [tutorial published by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) using the URL for this repository with the current version:

1. In Xcode, select ‚ÄúFile‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúAdd Packages...‚Äù
2. Enter `https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm.git`

Alternatively, you can add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm.git", from: "6.0.0")
```

### Why is there a separate repository for Swift Package Manager support?

The main git repository for [plaid-link-ios](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios) is very large (~1 GB), and Swift Package Manager always downloads the full repository with all git history. This [plaid-link-ios-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) repository is much smaller (less than 500kb), so can be downloaded much more quickly.

Instead of downloading the full git history of Plaid Link iOS and building it from source, this repository just contains a pointer to the precompiled XCFramework included in the [latest plaid-link-ios release](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios/releases/latest) (typically ~20MB). Since [plaid-link-ios](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios) doesn't provide source code it's strongly recommended that users depend on [plaid-link-ios-spm](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios-spm) instead.

When using plaid-link-ios-spm, the downloaded `LinkKit.xframework` isn't visible in the project navigator. To validate the authenticity of a plaid-link-ios-spm package, you can confirm that the `Package.swift` file references a binary XCFramework from https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios/releases. 

## Additional Support
